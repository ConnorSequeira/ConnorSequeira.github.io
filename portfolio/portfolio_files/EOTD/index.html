								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>The main goal of this project was to address the observed breakage 
										of the preexisting tooling design and create a more robust, durable solution.
										The failure of the original design highlighted the need for a thorough 
										evaluation and redesign, ensuring that the tooling could withstand the 
										stresses and operational demands of the pneumatic activated magnetic gripper.
										Using FEA software (SimScale),
										the objective was to assess the structural integrity of the original tooling 
										and identify areas for improvement, ultimately leading to a stronger 
										and more reliable design. </p>

							<h2>Gripper Design Iterations</h2>
							<p>Designing for Strength and Magnetism Adjustment</p>
						</header>
						<p>Multiple gripper endpiece designs were created to better hold the 
							cylindrical metal parts while improving magnetism. The 
							design iterations explored different shapes and materials 
							to adjust the distance between the magnet and the part,
							thereby improving the strength of the grip.
							Material selection played a crucial role in optimizing the
							magnetic field, ensuring the gripper's functionality was 
							aligned with the production requirements.</p>
						</div>
					<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
						<p>Additionally, the designs were optimized for 3D printing to ensure quick, 
							durable, and support-free printing. Features like streamlined 
							shapes and reinforced sections were included to prevent breakage 
							and ensure the tooling could be manufactured easily while
							maintaining its strength and longevity in the high-demand 
							operational environment.</p>

							<h2>Results</h2>
							<p>Improved Durability, Faster Production, and Less Down Time</p>
						</header>
						<p>The final tooling design proved to be much more robust and efficient than the original. 
							By using a lofted boss in the 3D CAD model, the new design printed faster and was 
							significantly more durable. The original tooling would break after just two hours of use, 
							but the new design has yet to break after extensive testing. FEA simulations confirmed
							the improvements in the design's structural integrity, 
							and the updated tooling now better meets the needs of the pneumatic activated magnetic 
							gripper, offering both reliability and longevity in production.</p>
